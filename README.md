## Introduction

`TwitchBooster` is a virus made by the 18-25. 18-25 is a category to make the people between 18 and 25 YO talk to each other from the french forum [jvc.com](https://www.jeuxvideo.com).
The mods of this forum were not payed so they stopped to mod this website. A group on this category got created, the people who created it are in the protagonists section.
This virus was made to troll the little streamer in their streams (mostly with their webcam activated), to make them fear, or stress just for *fun*...

Protagonists
</summary> <br />
  
### Twitch Game
   Name of several discord servers dedicated to raids. They follow one another over time.

### Damben
   Founder of the first Twitch Game in February 2016. At the time, Twitch Booster didn't yet exist, and forumers were raiding on Tinychat and making extensive use of the screamer cactus created in 2012.

### Sirop
   Founder of the second Twitch Game discord in July 2016. The Damben server flops and empties of members who go to the second server.

### Jewstice
   Participates in the founding of the new Twitch Game. He becomes one of the main protagonists of the period, laying the foundations for the Twitch Booster virus, which he codes clumsily and rudimentarily. He led numerous raids and started the War of Discords in March 2017.

### Sneus
   Founder of Risiraid in March 2017, a new raid server. He greatly improves the virus with Gin and makes it presentable which increases the power of raids tenfold. He created a new SneusRaid server following a disagreement with Gin shortly after an IRL with him and Pike.

### Gin / Sejo
   Risiraid Admin

### Pike
   Risiraid admin

### Fripinside
   Leaves Risiraid and creates his own server ExoodArmy more open to newfags in order to spread the word about the virus. Particularly young and immature.
